During my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I completed 4 tasks using Python. Below is a brief overview of each:

Task 1 – Caesar Cipher
Developed a Caesar Cipher program in Python that allows both encryption and decryption of text using a key.

Task 2 – Image Encryption and Decryption
Created a Python program to securely encrypt and decrypt images, ensuring data confidentiality.

Task 3 – Password Strength Checker
Built a Python tool to evaluate the strength of a password based on predefined security criteria.

Task 4 – Keylogger
